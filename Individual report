## WareHouseSystem, App, ReprotService, CustomerMenu, StaffMenu

### 2025-11-12

- I started desining the **WareHouseSystem** class and had to work on the class more than 2 hours
- and finished half the work.



### 2025-11-14

- I continued desining the class and i had a bit of a problem in local date which i forgot
- its a built in class and you dont need to do it.

### 2025-11-15
- I Started the other Classes and finished them at the same day with my friends **ReprotService, CustomerMenu, StaffMenu, App**
- **And the StaffMenu**. We had some issues in running the code some run time issues and pathway because of some copy paste from whatsApp because we do the code in our laptop and changes we send it to each other.


### 2025-11-16

- My friend and i had a bit of a conversation of how to do the local date
- on his methods in his classes and my class and we spent 1 hour solving the problems
- we saw them big problems but they were small like a curly braket or a parentheses.
      
  ### 2025-11-29

- I had some issues putting my code in the github app and i talked with my friends and they tried helping me but they needed to help themselves with it but at last we made it.

 

## Avantages
1. I learend things like how to implement local date in a class and how to work with it.
2. I learned how to put functions to add and delete.

## Disadvantages
1. I had too many problems on how to use the code in the github.
2. None of my friends knew how to work with it either and we spent too much time on something somewhat ridiculous.
