## WareHouseSystem, App, ReprotService, CustomerMenu, StaffMenu

### 2025-11-12

- I started desining the **WareHouseSystem** class and had to work on the class more than 2 hours
- and finished half the work.


### 2025-11-14

- I continued desining the class and i had a bit of a problem in local date which i forgot
- its a built in class and you dont need to do it.


### 2025-11-16

- My friend and i had a bit of a conversation of how to do the local date
- on his methods in his classes and my class and we spent 1 hour solving the problems
- we saw them big problems but they were small like a curly braket or a parentheses.
      
  ### 2025-11-29

  - We shared the code with each other and i testes my code and it ran had some run time issues
  - because of a mistake my friend had and because i also forgot not to copy paste codes
  - because it sometimes gives **Pathway Error** message.
 

## Avantages
1. I learend things like how to implement local date in a class and how to work with it.
2. I learned how to put functions to add and delete.

## Disadvantages
1. I had too many problems on how to use the code in the github.
2. None of my friends knew how to work with it either and we spent too much time on something somewhat ridiculous.
